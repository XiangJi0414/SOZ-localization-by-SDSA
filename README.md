# SOZ-localization-by-SDSA
Code used for this paper "A universal method for seizure onset zone localization in focal epilepsy using standard deviation of spike amplitude" is contained in this repository.
To protect the privacy of all patients, we give a manuscript "SDSA_eg.m" to demonstrate how to compute the SDSA metric and use the SDSA to detect seizures, and localize the SOZ.
The SEEG data in "SDSA_eg.m" is generated by random function, so you should replace it with the real SEEG data when you apply our method.
