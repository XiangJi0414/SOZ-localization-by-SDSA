# SOZ-localization-by-SDSA
Code used for this paper "A universal method for seizure onset zone localization in focal epilepsy using standard deviation of spike amplitude" is contained in this repository.

To protect the privacy of all patients, we give a script named "SDSA_eg.m" to demonstrate how to compute the SDSA metric and use the SDSA to detect seizures, and localize the SOZ.

The SEEG data in "SDSA_eg.m" is generated by random function, so you should replace it with the real SEEG data when you apply our method.

To ensure the authenticity of the research, we have provided the data of S09 and the corresponding processing script Main_S09. m. If you need to download the data of S09, please change to the "master" branch.

Matlab 2021b was tested successful and Filedtrip Toolbox is required to run the script.
